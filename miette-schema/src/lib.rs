//! # miette-schema
//!
//! This library provides type definitions and derives for
//! Serializing/Deserializing miette's JSON output using serde, and for getting
//! a schema of the format. The schema is based on [schemars][], which
//! understands your serde attributes.
//!
//! This idea is that if you have your own JSON output that may include miette
//! JSON output, you can slap the top-level [`Diagnostic`][] type in your own
//! types and get serde able to read/write it properly, and if you want a schema
//! for your entire output format then you can just slap `#[derive(JsonSchema)]`
//! on your own types and use `schemars::schema_for!(MyType)` to get the final
//! JSON Schema.
//!
//! The type definitions here are more conservative than what miette's JSON
//! output actually looks like to make the schema maximally
//! forward/backward-compatible with past/future versions of miette.
//!
//! Basically you should ideally assume every field is Optional because
//! older versions might be missing it and newer versions might remove it. Not
//! because we have any plans to break the format, but just because it's Best
//! Practice to prepare for that eventuality and interchange formats inevitably
//! result in version drift. We implement this by placing `#[serde(default)]` on
//! everything we can.
//!
//! This pretty closely matches how miette's JSON Output works in practice
//! today: every field is always emitted, and it just emits an empty string or
//! an empty array when there's no value. So in practice the
//! `#[serde(default)]`s won't ever be stressed, because miette itself pre-bakes
//! them in. So write code that's aware of empty strings!
//!
//! You also need to be tolerant of additional things being added in the future,
//! but thankfully that's just how Json Schema and serde already work, by
//! silently dropping unknown values on the floor... except for enum variants.
//!
//! We had to add an extra Unknown variant to every enum to capture "unknown
//! variants". Simply making the enum `#[non_exhaustive]` is insufficient
//! because the Rust compiler needs to put *something* there at runtime.
